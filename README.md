# power-query-using-excel

In this project, I extracted the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics medal table from Wikipedia using Power Query in Excel. The data was collected directly from a web source and transformed into a structured tabular format. I cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, renaming headers, converting data types, and ensuring numerical consistency. The final dataset includes country-wise ranking along with gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. The query supports automatic refresh, allowing updated data to be fetched with a single click.
